Segmentation in quantitative modeling is done for several key reasons:

	1.	Improved Accuracy: By dividing a heterogeneous population into more homogeneous subgroups, models can make more accurate predictions within each segment. This reduces variability and increases precision.
	2.	Targeted Insights: Segmentation allows for the identification of specific characteristics, behaviors, or needs of different groups. This helps in understanding diverse customer segments or market niches more deeply.
	3.	Personalization: With segmented data, businesses can tailor their strategies, marketing efforts, and products to meet the specific needs of each segment, leading to better customer satisfaction and engagement.
	4.	Resource Optimization: It enables more efficient allocation of resources by focusing efforts on the most profitable or high-potential segments.
	5.	Enhanced Decision-Making: Segmentation provides detailed insights that support better strategic decision-making, allowing businesses to identify and capitalize on opportunities within each segment.

Overall, segmentation helps in creating more effective, efficient, and focused quantitative models by acknowledging and leveraging the diversity within the data.

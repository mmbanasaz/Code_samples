Estimating a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model with non-stationary data can lead to several significant issues:

1. **Spurious Regression**: Non-stationary time series data, characterized by trends or random walks, can lead to misleading statistical relationships known as spurious regressions. This occurs when two or more non-stationary series are regressed against each other, possibly suggesting a relationship where none exists.

2. **Integration and Cointegration**: If the variables in a VAR are non-stationary, they need to be tested for unit roots. If the variables are integrated of order one, I(1), they may be cointegrated. If cointegration exists, this implies a long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables, which should be modeled differently using techniques like Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) instead of standard VAR.

3. **Inconsistent and Biased Estimates**: Using non-stationary data in VAR models without addressing the stationarity can lead to inconsistent and biased parameter estimates. This affects the reliability of any forecasts, impulse responses, or variance decompositions derived from the model.

To address these issues, the data can often be transformed to stationarity through differencing, detrending, or transformation, which can stabilize the mean and variance. Alternatively, if the series are cointegrated, a VECM approach may be used.

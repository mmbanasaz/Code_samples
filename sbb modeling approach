Predictive modeling for non-maturity deposit (NMD) balances is essential for banks to manage liquidity and interest rate risks. The literature identifies key determinants such as economic conditions, interest rates, and customer demographics that significantly influence deposit balances. Macroeconomic variables like GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation impact depositor behavior, while the sensitivity of depositors to interest rate changes plays a critical role. Additionally, demographic factors such as age, income level, and financial sophistication shape deposit behaviors.

Various modeling techniques have been explored to predict NMD balances. Traditional statistical models, including linear and logistic regression, help identify relationships between deposit balances and predictors. Time-series models like ARIMA and GARCH capture trends and volatility over time, providing insights into future deposit volumes. Advanced machine learning models, including neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines, offer enhanced predictive power by handling complex, non-linear relationships. Segmentation of customers based on behavior and demographics further improves model accuracy, while incorporating behavioral economic theories enhances predictions.

Applications of these predictive models are crucial for effective bank management. Accurate predictions of NMD balances assist banks in maintaining adequate liquidity buffers and optimizing liquid asset allocation. Understanding deposit behaviors also enables banks to develop strategies for managing interest rate risk through hedging and other financial instruments. Key studies, such as those by Avery and Berger (1991), Buchak et al. (2018), Stefan and Bonaccorsi di Patti (2013), and Glaser and Weber (2009), provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing NMD balances and the methodologies employed in their prediction. These studies highlight the importance of considering economic, interest rate, and behavioral factors in predictive modeling.
